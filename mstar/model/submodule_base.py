        Default: derives from ``get_accelerator_graph_configs`` — if any declared
        config can replay for this batch's graph_walk, CUDA graphs are
        supported. We check ``cfg.replay_graph_walks`` (not just
        ``cfg.capture_graph_walk``) so aliased walks — e.g. Qwen3-Omni's
        ``prefill_audio`` reusing the ``prefill_text`` capture, or
        ``prefill_vision`` reusing its own — are correctly admitted at the

        ``replay_graph_walks``; this keeps the gate consistent so aliased
        walks don't silently fall through to the eager path.

        ``replay_graph_walks`` is always a superset of ``{capture_graph_walk}``
        (see ``AcceleratorGraphConfig.__init__``), so this never narrows what the
        previous code accepted — only widens it for configs that explicitly
        declared aliases.

        Per-request postprocessing on the submodule outputs.

        Runs on the GPU thread inside ``execute_batch``, after the forward
        (eager, batched, or CUDA-graph replay). ``inputs`` is the request's
        ``prepare_inputs`` result for this step, so a submodule can finish a
        step the captured graph could not hold (e.g. combine guidance branches
        and run a Python multistep scheduler against the step's input latents).

        Keep it metadata-only where possible. **Avoid reading tensor values**
        — ``.item()`` / ``.cpu()`` sync here block the GPU thread and forfeit
        the worker's async-scheduling overlap; stop-condition decisions that
        need token values (e.g. EOS) belong in ``check_stop``. A captured-path
        tail that must read scheduler state is the sanctioned exception — it
        costs the same sync wherever it runs.

        Typical uses:
          - rebind output names for graph routing (``outputs["text_inputs"] =
            outputs["new_token"]``);
          - drop keys on a per-request basis for static-capture submodules
            (e.g. Qwen3-Omni Thinker dropping ``thinker_states`` for requests
            that don't need audio);
          - finish a captured step from ``inputs`` (Cosmos3 denoise tail).

        Stops returned here are deferred by one step: they apply to the

        (already submitted under the assumption that the rid continues)
        will run for that rid and its output discarded — the standard
