"""Pin the FlashInfer seed/offset contract the Talker's graph sampler relies on.

The Talker samples stochastically (temperature ~0.9, top_k ~50) under accelerator-graph
capture. ``AcceleratorGraphableSampler.sample`` passes per-request philox
``seed``/``offset`` as captured int tensors and advances ``offset_buf += 1``
in-graph so each replay steps the RNG (see the comments in
``mstar/utils/sampling.py`` about a frozen offset never reaching EOS).

This requires a FlashInfer build whose ``*_sampling_from_probs`` binding accepts
tensor seed/offset under graph capture. FlashInfer 0.6.3 rejected tensors at the
C/TVM-FFI layer ("Mismatched type on argument #7"); the binding was reworked in
0.6.4 (verified: 0.6.3 rejects; 0.6.4 / 0.6.5 / 0.6.7.post3 accept and advance
the RNG under capture), which ``pyproject.toml`` now pins as the floor. These
tests fail fast on a too-old build and pin the two facts the design depends on:

  1. a captured tensor ``offset`` ADVANCES the RNG per replay (stochastic
     sampling actually varies step to step);
  2. passing ``offset=None`` under capture is NOT a valid shortcut -- it makes
     FlashInfer read its default CUDA generator's ``current_seed()``, which is
     illegal during capture. (Pins why the captured path must pass a real
     tensor, not None.)

Skips when CUDA / FlashInfer are unavailable.
