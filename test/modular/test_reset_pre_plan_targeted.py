"""Tests for slot-targeted ``reset_pre_plan_state_for_slot`` (PR #78 issue #5).

Old ``Worker._reset_skip_plan_flags`` walked every captured graph of every
engine across the worker on every speculation drop / pre-plan failure. With
``plan_executor.max_workers > 1``, that would stomp any sibling slot's
in-flight pre-plan whose ``_pre_planned_labels`` set hasn't yet been
consumed by the matching replay.

The fix added ``AcceleratorGraphRunner.reset_pre_plan_state_for_slot`` to clear
just one (key, slot)'s pre-plan state. These tests drive the runner method
directly with a stub graphs dict, verifying that:

  - the targeted (key, slot)'s flags are cleared;
  - other slots of the SAME key are untouched;
  - other keys' slots are untouched;
  - mismatched / unknown shapes are no-ops (don't raise).
