Installation
============

Requirements
------------

- **Python 3.12+**.
- **Linux with an NVIDIA GPU** and a recent **CUDA** toolkit for the GPU model
  families. A CPU-only machine can exercise the graph/worker plumbing in *dummy mode*
  (submodules return ``None``) for development and the modular tests, but not real model
  inference.
- Enough GPU memory for the model you intend to serve — several families (e.g.
  BAGEL-7B, Qwen3-Omni-30B) are multi-GPU-class models.

Install from source
-------------------

``mstar`` is installed from source in editable mode. We recommend `uv
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ to create the Python 3.12 environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mstar-project/mstar.git
   cd mstar

   # Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtualenv (--seed adds pip to it)
   uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
   source .venv/bin/activate

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e .

This pulls in the core runtime (PyTorch, FastAPI/Uvicorn, ZMQ, …) and installs the two
console scripts, ``mstar`` and ``mstar-serve``.

.. important::

   **Always pass** ``--torch-backend=auto``. ``mstar`` floors PyTorch at 2.9
   (``torch>=2.9.1`` / ``torchvision>=0.24.1`` / ``torchaudio>=2.9.1``). The flag tells 
   ``uv`` to detect your driver's CUDA version and fetch the **matching** torch build
   — cu128 on a CUDA 12.x box, cu130 on a CUDA 13.x box. This matters because source-
   compiled extensions (``flash-attn``) and the JIT-built MoE kernel for Qwen3-Omni
   compile against your *system* CUDA toolkit, whose major version must match torch's.
   Without the flag ``uv`` installs PyPI's default (cu128) build. You can set it once
   with ``export UV_TORCH_BACKEND=auto`` instead of repeating the flag. See `Matching your
   CUDA toolkit`_ for details and the manual fallback.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

Model families and some output formats need extra packages, exposed as pip *extras*:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 78

   * - Extra
     - Installs / use for
   * - ``.[bagel]``
     - BAGEL runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``einops``, ``Pillow``, ``torchvision`` / ``torchaudio`` / ``torchcodec``,
       ``huggingface-hub``, ``regex``, and ``mooncake-transfer-engine`` (RDMA transport).
   * - ``.[qwen3_omni]``
     - Qwen3-Omni runtime: the BAGEL set plus ``qwen-omni-utils``, ``datasets``, and
       ``ninja`` (speeds up the JIT build of the vendored MoE align kernel).
       **Also needs** ``flash-attn``, which is installed separately —
       see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_.
   * - ``.[orpheus]``
     - Orpheus TTS runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``einops``, ``huggingface-hub``, ``mooncake-transfer-engine``.
   * - ``.[pi05]``
     - Pi0.5 runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``triton``, ``huggingface-hub``, ``mooncake-transfer-engine``.
   * - ``.[vjepa2]`` / ``.[vjepa2_ac]``
     - V-JEPA 2 runtime: ``safetensors``, ``torchcodec``, ``huggingface-hub``,
       ``mooncake-transfer-engine`` (``vjepa2_ac`` also adds ``flashinfer-python``).
   * - ``.[audio]``
     - ``soundfile`` — only needed to return **non-WAV** audio containers (mp3/flac/…)
       from the OpenAI/SDK audio surfaces. WAV/PCM output works without it.
   * - ``.[dev]``
     - ``ruff`` + ``pytest`` for linting and the test suite.
   * - ``.[all]``
     - The union of every model extra above — installs the full runtime for all model
       families in one shot. Convenient for a machine that serves multiple models; heavier
       and slower to install than a single family's extra. (Still excludes ``flash-attn`` —
       see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_.)

Combine extras as needed (keep ``--torch-backend=auto`` on every install):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[bagel,audio,dev]"

.. tip::

   If you're just getting started or have the disk/time to spare, ``.[all]`` is the
   recommended install — it pulls every model family's runtime so any model works out of
   the box, with no need to track which extra goes with which model:

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[all,dev]"

.. note::

   ``torch``, ``torchvision``, and ``torchaudio`` are already in the base install; each
   model extra adds that family's remaining runtime — FlashInfer for the autoregressive
   backbones, Transformers, safetensors, any codec/media libraries, and the Mooncake RDMA
   transport for disaggregated deployments.

GPU libraries
-------------

The GPU model families depend on:

- **FlashInfer** (``flashinfer-python``) — paged attention and continuous batching for the
  autoregressive backbones (every model with a ``KV_CACHE`` node runs attention through it).
- **flash-attn** — used by Qwen3-Omni. **Not installed by any extra**; install it separately
  (see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_).
- **mooncake-transfer-engine** — RDMA tensor transport for multi-GPU, disaggregated
  deployments. Single-node deployments can use shared-memory (``SHM``) or ``TCP`` transport
  instead (see :doc:`serving`).

Apart from ``flash-attn``, these are installed by the extras above. Your installed ``torch``
must match your system CUDA toolkit — ``--torch-backend=auto`` handles that for you (next
section).

flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)
-----------------------

``flash-attn`` is only needed for **Qwen3-Omni**, and it is **not** pulled in by
``.[qwen3_omni]`` or ``.[all]`` — you install it as a separate step. The reason: flash-attn
publishes no wheels on PyPI, so ``pip``/``uv`` fall back to compiling it from source, which is
slow. When a prebuilt GitHub wheel matches your stack, use it to skip the build; otherwise
build from source (see `No matching wheel — build from source`_ below).

The wheels live on flash-attn's `GitHub releases
<https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases>`_, named by CUDA major, torch
**minor** version, Python tag, and C++ ABI. ``mstar`` no longer pins torch (floor
``>=2.9.1``), so the wheel's ``torchX.Y`` tag must match **whatever torch you actually
installed**, and its ``cu1x`` must match that torch's CUDA build — not your system toolkit.
Check both first:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda)"
   # e.g. 2.12.1+cu130 13.0  ->  torch2.12 / cu13
   #      2.9.1+cu128  12.8  ->  torch2.9  / cu12

Pick the release that has a wheel for your torch minor (each flash-attn release lists which
``torchX.Y`` tags it ships), then install it by **direct URL** (don't use ``--find-links`` —
uv sorts the ``+cu13…`` local version above ``+cu12…`` and will grab cu13 even on a CUDA 12
box). The examples below are for **torch 2.9**; substitute the ``torch2.9`` segment with your
own tag. Note the prebuilt wheels **top out at** ``torch2.10`` (``cu13``, in release
``v2.8.3``) — there is **no** ``torch2.11+`` wheel, so on newer torch (e.g. 2.12) you must
build from source instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   # torch built for CUDA 12.x (cu12)
   uv pip install \
     "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"

   # torch built for CUDA 13.x (cu13)
   uv pip install \
     "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu13torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"

Because it's a binary wheel nothing compiles, so your *system* CUDA version is irrelevant —
only the torch build matters. Verify with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"

(An ``undefined symbol`` error on import means the wheel's ``cu1x`` / ``torchX.Y`` tag doesn't
match your installed torch — recheck ``python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__,
torch.version.cuda)"`` and pick the matching wheel.)

No matching wheel — build from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no prebuilt wheel matches your torch minor (the wheels stop at ``torch2.10``, so this is
the case on **torch 2.11+**), compile from source. A source build compiles against **whatever
torch you have installed**, so the torch-minor mismatch goes away. flash-attn 2.8.3 builds
against a CUDA-13 toolkit, but **only if you restrict the target architectures** (see below) —
the default arch list pulls in Blackwell targets that don't compile under nvcc 13.x. It is a
long compile (tens of minutes).

Three things to get right:

* ``FLASH_ATTN_CUDA_ARCHS`` — set it to **only your GPU's compute capability** (H100 →
  ``"90"``, A100 → ``"80"``). By default flash-attn builds ``80;90;100;120``, and on a CUDA 13
  toolkit that includes the Blackwell targets (``sm_100``/``sm_120``). flash-attn 2.8.3's
  kernels **fail to compile for Blackwell under nvcc 13.x** — the build dies on
  ``flash_bwd_hdim256_*`` with a bare ``[code=255]`` (the only hint upstream is a ``double4``
  *deprecation* warning, which is not itself the error). Restricting the arch list avoids the
  broken targets and cuts build time several-fold.
* ``--no-build-isolation`` — build against your *installed* torch. Without it, uv builds in an
  isolated env that pulls a fresh (possibly different-minor) torch, defeating the point.
* ``psutil`` must be importable **before** the build — flash-attn's ``setup.py`` imports it to
  size the parallel compile, and it is not declared as a build dependency.

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install psutil
   FLASH_ATTN_CUDA_ARCHS="90" uv pip install flash-attn==2.8.3.post1 --no-build-isolation
   python -c "import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"

Matching your CUDA toolkit
--------------------------

PyPI's default ``torch`` wheel targets one specific CUDA release (cu128), which may not match
your machine. ``flash-attn`` compiles from source, and the vendored MoE align kernel
JIT-compiles on first use, both against your *system* CUDA — so a mismatch with torch's
CUDA breaks the build. The simplest fix is to let ``uv`` choose the right build
automatically:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[all]"

``--torch-backend=auto`` detects your driver (via ``nvidia-smi``) and selects the matching
PyTorch index — cu128 on CUDA 12.x, cu130 on CUDA 13.x — for the runtime *and* for the
isolated environment that builds ``flash-attn``. The same command therefore
works unchanged across machines. (Needs a recent ``uv`` — run ``uv pip install --help`` and
look for ``--torch-backend`` if unsure; ``export UV_TORCH_BACKEND=auto`` is equivalent.)

**Manual fallback.** If you can't use the flag, install the pinned torch trio from the
matching CUDA index **first**, then install ``mstar`` (the resolver then treats the
requirement as already satisfied):

.. code-block:: bash

   # pick the index for your CUDA toolkit: cu128 (CUDA 12.8), cu130 (CUDA 13.x), …
   uv pip install torch==2.9.1 torchvision==0.24.1 torchaudio==2.9.1 \
       --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
   uv pip install -e ".[all]"

Check your driver's CUDA version with ``nvidia-smi`` and pick the closest build at
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. Keep all three packages on the same ``2.9`` /
``0.24`` line — ``torchvision`` and ``torchaudio`` are versioned in lockstep with ``torch``.

Verify the install
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import mstar; print('mstar import OK')"
   mstar --help
   mstar-serve --help

Optional: Rust support
----------------------

Parts of the runtime can run on Rust components (vendored in ``rust/``),
each optional and selectable per process — without the extension everything
runs on the pure-Python paths as before. Migrated so far (see
:doc:`environment_variables` for the flags):

* **ZeroMQ control mesh** — ``MSTAR_RUST_ZMQ``: same endpoints, same wire
  format as pyzmq.
* **SHM tensor arena** — ``MSTAR_SHM_ARENA``: replaces the per-tensor file
  transport; requires the extension, interoperates on the same descriptor
  wire (and depends on the transport above only in the sense that both ship
  in the same extension).

Build the extension into your environment with `maturin
<https://www.maturin.rs>`_ (needs a Rust toolchain; ``rustup`` works):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install maturin
   maturin develop --release -m rust/Cargo.toml

Build with ``--release`` — an unoptimized debug build (maturin's default)
costs real latency on the hot receive path. Verify with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import mstar_rust; print('mstar_rust OK')"
   pytest test/rust/test_rust_communicator.py

Optional: the Rust HTTP frontend
--------------------------------

``mstar-server`` (``rust/server/``) serves the HTTP surface — routes, OpenAI
translation, SSE streaming, uploads — from Rust, with the Python process
keeping preprocessing and the conductor protocol. Build and opt in:

.. code-block:: bash

   cargo build --release --manifest-path rust/server/Cargo.toml
   mstar serve qwen3_omni --rust-frontend
   # or, with an explicit config: mstar-serve --config <model.yaml> --rust-frontend

The binary is resolved via ``--rust-frontend-bin`` / ``MSTAR_SERVER_BIN`` /
``$PATH`` / the in-repo build. Its knobs are listed in
:doc:`environment_variables`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

``CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symptom — a convolution (or another cuDNN op) aborts with::

   RuntimeError: ... cudnn_status: CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH

This affects **CUDA 12** installs (a ``+cu12x`` torch) running on a host that *also* has a
**newer system cuDNN (≥ 9.21)** on the default loader path (e.g. ``/usr/lib64``). PyTorch's
cu12 wheels pin ``nvidia-cudnn-cu12==9.20.0.48``, and that slim wheel omits the
``libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir`` engine. When cuDNN needs that engine it loads it from the
system copy instead — and a 9.20 dispatcher paired with a ≥ 9.21 engine is the mismatch.
Boxes with no system cuDNN, or a matching one, are unaffected, as are CUDA 13 installs
(they use ``nvidia-cudnn-cu13``).

Fix — complete the environment's own cuDNN so it never falls back to the system copy:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --no-deps -U "nvidia-cudnn-cu12>=9.21"

``--no-deps`` leaves torch in place; pip may print a harmless warning that torch pins
``9.20.0.48``. cuDNN is ABI-compatible within the v9 series, so the newer patch runs fine.

Next: :doc:`quickstart`.
