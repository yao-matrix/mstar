Serving
=======

``mstar`` has two ways to start a server:

- ``mstar serve <model>`` — a one-command wrapper with sensible per-model defaults (most
  single-GPU; a few multi-GPU). Best for getting started and single-node runs.
- ``mstar-serve --config <yaml>`` — the low-level entry point that takes an explicit
  config. Use it for custom layouts, disaggregation, and tensor parallelism.

``mstar serve`` resolves a default config for the model, fills in the plumbing that
``mstar-serve`` needs (socket/upload dirs, a single-node-safe tensor protocol, the HF
cache), and then delegates to it.

mstar serve

.. code-block:: bash

   mstar serve <model> [options]

``<model>`` is one of ``bagel``, ``bagel_cfg_parallel``, ``qwen3_omni``, ``orpheus``,
``pi05``, ``vjepa2``, ``vjepa2_ac`` (or pass ``--config`` for any other deployment).

.. note::

   ``mstar serve`` defaults the tensor protocol to ``SHM`` (safe on a single node),
   whereas ``mstar-serve`` defaults to ``RDMA``. On a single node without RDMA, pass
   ``--tensor-comm-protocol SHM`` to ``mstar-serve``.

Config files
------------

A config maps the model's computation-graph nodes to physical GPU ranks. The keys:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Key
     - Meaning
   * - ``model``
     - Registry key of the model (see :doc:`models`).
   * - ``max_seq_len``
     - Maximum sequence length (sizes the KV cache).
   * - ``node_groups``
     - List of placements. Each entry assigns ``node_names`` to ``ranks``, optionally
       scoped to specific ``graph_walks`` and/or sharded with ``tp_size``.
   * - ``resources``
     - *(optional)* Per-resource overrides, keyed by the model's resource names (see
       below).
   * - ``model_kwargs``
     - *(optional)* Server-init model parameters (see below).

Node names are model-specific — they are the node names appearing in the model's graph
walks (e.g. BAGEL's ``vit_encoder`` / ``vae_encoder`` / ``LLM``, Orpheus's ``LLM`` /
``snac_decoder``).

**Resource overrides.** A model declares the KV caches, attention backends, positions and
samplers that its nodes need. Each declaration has a ``resource_key``. A deployment tunes
them by that name:

.. code-block:: yaml

   resources:
     kv_cache:
       max_num_pages: 1024      # also: page_size, max_seq_len, cpu_offload_pages
     talker_attn:
       flashinfer_backend: fa2  # also: backend (flashinfer / dense)
     vit_attn:                  # a cacheless (ragged) attention resource
       max_segments_per_request: 2  # also: max_tokens_per_request, flashinfer_backend

Use one block per resource. A model with two caches, such as Whisper's decoder cache and
its encoder context, can therefore size each one separately. If a block names a resource
that the model does not declare, or sets a key that the resource does not accept, loading
fails. A misspelled setting is never silently ignored. A top-level ``kv_cache:`` block is
no longer read. It raises an error with a message describing the migration.

**Single GPU.** Everything on rank 0:

.. code-block:: yaml

   model: "bagel"
   max_seq_len: 32768
   node_groups:
     - {node_names: [vit_encoder], ranks: [0]}
     - {node_names: [vae_encoder, vae_decoder], ranks: [0]}
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [0]}

**Disaggregation.** The same node can live on different GPUs *per graph walk* — e.g.
prefill, decode, and image generation on three GPUs:

.. code-block:: yaml

   node_groups:
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [0], graph_walks: [prefill_text, prefill_vit, prefill_vae]}
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [1], graph_walks: [decode]}
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [2], graph_walks: [image_gen]}

Because placement is config-only, the *same* model code runs single-GPU or fully
disaggregated. ``configs/`` ships several layouts per model (``*_single_gpu``,
``*_colocated``, ``*_pd_disaggregated``, ``*_cfg_parallel``, …).

**Tensor parallelism.** Shard a node across GPUs with ``tp_size`` and that many ``ranks``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   model: "orpheus"
   max_seq_len: 131072
   node_groups:
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [0, 1], tp_size: 2, graph_walks: [prefill, decode]}
     - {node_names: [snac_decoder], ranks: [0], graph_walks: [snac_chunk]}

A node must be declared TP-enabled by the model to be eligible for ``tp_size > 1``; the
weight loaders then shard parameters automatically, with no model-code changes. See
:ref:`Tensor parallelism <tensor-parallelism>` in the model guide for the model-side
details.

model_kwargs
------------

``model_kwargs`` are model parameters fixed at server start (not per request) — they are
baked into the model's config dataclass and into CUDA-graph captures. For example, the
Pi0.5 DROID variant fixes the action horizon:

.. code-block:: yaml

   model: "pi05"
   max_seq_len: 2048
   model_kwargs:
     action_horizon: 15
   node_groups:
     - {node_names: [vit_encoder], ranks: [0]}
     - {node_names: [LLM], ranks: [0]}

Per-request knobs (``temperature``, ``voice``, ``max_output_tokens``, …) are sent by the
client instead — see :doc:`clients`.

.. _tensor-transport:

Tensor transport
----------------

Workers route tensors directly to one another using one of three transports, selected with
``--tensor-comm-protocol``:

- ``SHM`` — shared memory; the safe default for single-node deployments.
- ``TCP`` — works anywhere; used for some multi-node setups.
- ``RDMA`` — lowest latency for multi-GPU / multi-node, via the Mooncake transfer engine
  (requires RDMA-capable networking).

.. _request-profiling:

Request profiling
-----------------

Pass ``--log-stats`` (to either ``mstar serve`` or ``mstar-serve``) to print a per-request
profile when each request finishes. Add ``--log-stats-file <path>`` to append the profiles
to a file instead of stdout (it implies ``--log-stats``):

.. code-block:: bash

   mstar serve bagel --log-stats
   mstar-serve --config configs/orpheus_colocated.yaml --log-stats-file stats.txt

The report has four sections (any that has no data is omitted):

.. code-block:: text

    Inputs:

      tx (registered/written for send), by source:
        worker_0
          hidden                  106.7 MiB       0.90 ms  (x49)
   ============================================================

**Inputs / Outputs** — per-modality count and byte size. Inputs are the *raw*
client-supplied bytes (uploaded file sizes on disk, UTF-8 length of the prompt), not the
much larger decoded tensors, so they line up with what was sent over the wire.

**Timeline** — wall-clock stage boundaries for the request as it flows
``api server → conductor → workers → api server``. Stages are ordered by their actual
timestamp, so a stage is never negative even when two checkpoints race (e.g. the API
server's ``last chunk`` and the conductor's ``done`` can arrive in either order). All
timestamps are ``time.perf_counter()``; they are comparable across the api-server,
conductor, and worker processes because those run on the **same host** (``perf_counter`` is
``CLOCK_MONOTONIC``, which is boot-relative and shared).
This implementation will be updated when multi-node support is added.

**Graph timings** — CPU time per ``(node, graph_walk)``, accumulated over the request.
Each cell shows the **total over the request** and, in parentheses, the **average per
execution** (``n`` is the execution count, so e.g. one entry covers all ``588`` decode
steps). The columns:

- ``all`` — the full node execution (= ``pre`` + ``fwd`` + ``post``).
- ``fwd`` — the GPU forward region. Because execution is asynchronous and *not* synced
  (a sync would serialize the pipeline), this measures the CPU launch/enqueue span of the
  whole batch, not per-request GPU time.
- ``pre`` — input preparation / preprocessing before the launch.
- ``post`` — CPU postprocess after the forward. Marked ``post*`` because under
  speculative scheduling it can overlap the next step's forward or another in-flight
  batch, so it is **not necessarily additive**.

**Tensor transfer** — bytes moved between entities via the tensor transport
(:ref:`above <tensor-transport>`). ``rx`` (received) is grouped by ``source → dest``; ``tx``
(sent) is grouped by source only — the sender registers/writes data without knowing a
priori which worker will read it (and may register data that is never sent), so there is no
per-destination breakdown. ``size`` is total bytes, the time is transport cost (the
RDMA-read or SHM file-read time on ``rx``; the registration / serialize-and-write time on
``tx``), and ``count`` is the number of tensors.

.. note::

   Profiling is gated end-to-end on ``--log-stats``: when it is off, the workers,
   conductor, and data worker skip the timing/transfer bookkeeping entirely.
